Prototype Python bindings for the PAPI library for hardware
performance monitoring.

To build, edit setup.py to point papi_dir to the root of your PAPI
installation.  Then install as normal python package.

Supported events on the current platform are automatically initialised
as class members of the pypapi.Event object.  The print representation
reports any information PAPI has about the event.

Usage:

import pypapi
import numpy as np

events = np.asarray([pypapi.Event.L1_DCM, pypapi.Event.TOT_CYC],
                    dtype=pypapi.EventType)

pypapi.start_counters(events)

# Do some work

counts = np.empty(2, dtype=pypapi.CountType)

pypapi.stop_counters(counts)

print counts
